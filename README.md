# CPP programming


Learning the basics of the c++ programming language. The first problem I came across asked me to write a code to swap the value of two variables.
I went through the variables and constants, which are storage spaces we create in a code to keep or receive data. I went through the naming conventions, ie how the variables and constants are typed in the code: camel case, pascal case, snake case and hungarian notation.
The use of mathematical expressions and the reason behind using the variables(int, float, double).
